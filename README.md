# Mangnani, Riot Account Verifier Discord Bot

Mangnani is a Discord bot designed to automate Riot account verification and assign rank-based roles in League of Legends communities.

## Current Features
- Fetches actual Summoner rank/profile data using the Riot API
- Automatically assigns Discord roles based on Summoner rank

- Basic Discord slash command interactions

## Planned Features
- Automatic self-verification via Riot Sign On (RSO) API

This bot is primarily intended for Korean-speaking communities. As such, some parts of the code include logic for translating or adapting rank names and messages into Korean (ex, converting "GOLD" to "골드").
